		<h3>Easily my favorite meal</h3>

		<p style="font-size: 18px;">My favorite dish is a filet with potato gratin and roasted brussels sprouts. Steak has always been a favorite of mine as well as cheesy potatoes. The brussels sprouts are a new edition to this meal as of a couple years ago. The filet is my favorite cut of meat because of its combination of tenderness and flavor. My favorite type of potatoes to accompany this piece of meat is potato gratin because of the creamy buttery, cheesy potatoes. I also enjoy the brussels sprouts to add in my vegetables. </p>

				<p>I am the youngest in a family of 4. My family consists of my mother (<u>Dana</u>), my father (<u>Josh</u>), and my Sister (<u>Maddie</u>).</p>
				<p>As I have grown up, I have adopted the term, 'family comes first'. This saying showcases my core values. I know that they will always be by my side through thick and thin, while I would do the same. One thing that all of us share, is our interest in board games. Throughout my life, I have played many board games, in particular Sequence and Michigan Rummy. Another activity we do often is going to sporting events. We all enjoy the atmosphere and ambience. </p>
